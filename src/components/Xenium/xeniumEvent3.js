            <h4>Rules</h4>
            1) This is a solo event.
            <br /> 2) The event will consist of two rounds, Preliminary and
            Mains.
            <br /> 3) We have made a code that randomly selects a topic for the
            participant.
            <br /> 4) Participant will be given 150 seconds in the prelims and
            80 seconds in mains to describe the topic in his words.
            <br /> 5) Using words and phrases which hurt the sentiments of any
            religion, caste and race will not be tolerated. The participant will
            be eliminated on the spot.
            <br /> 6) As soon as the clock starts for the participant, he/she
            has to speak about the positives of the given topic. After exactly
            half time (75 seconds in prelims and 40 seconds in mains) a bell
            will ring which means now the participant has to speak about the
            negative of the topic.
            <br /> 7) The decision of judges will be final and binding.
